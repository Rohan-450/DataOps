## About The Project

This project is a a dedicated repository for PCC-CS391, also known as Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository is a treasure trove of knowledge, encompassing a vast array of codebases that delve into both linear and non-linear data structures. 

It houses a collection of codebases covering both linear and non-linear data structures, encompassing essential concepts such as stacks, queues, linked lists, graphs, and trees and their various applications.The repository serves as a centralized resource for students and enthusiasts to access and explore a diverse range of problems and implementations related to this crucial field of computer science.



## Built With

All the codebases are written in C/C++
